### read me if you is lost

ok so we have our backend heroku serrver up and running and set in our tokens.json.

Our contract is not compiling due to some silidity version comiler error. 

It says I have shit depending on ^0.8.0 and after changing my contract to 0.8.0 its still fucked.

This is where to pick up.

OH SHIT

we are compiled...

-need to write tests
-test
-test minting
-see if we can do this without a frontend preferrably
